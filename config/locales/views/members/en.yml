        application_process: As soon as your prospective pilgrim fills out the application form, what very important thing to you need to do?
        application_process_text_html: "Sit down with the pilgrim and go over every answer. Check for readability with him or her, as well as spelling (phone numbers and emails especially!). Print clarification spellings beside the original entry if you need to. <strong>K</strong>’s can look a lot like <strong>h</strong>’s, and <strong>h</strong>’s look a lot like <strong>b</strong>’s. <strong>4’s and 9’s, 5’s</strong>, and <strong>6’s</strong> can be hard to decipher as well!"
        conference_room: Can a person who is serving in the Conference Room, sponsor a Pilgrim to attend the Walk?
        conference_room_text: No. If you are serving in the Conference Room, you will not be able to attend Sponsor’s Hour and pray over your Pilgrim’s cross, or be available to the Pilgrim’s Family if they are in need of assistance at their home, or have an emergency and need to get up with your Pilgrim, Nor could you take your Pilgrim home if for any reason they need to leave early. A Sponsor’s job is one of support to both the Pilgrim AND to the family. You need to be on the ‘outside’ and able to attend Sponsors Hour, Candlelight, and Closing as a Sponsor, not a participant, and be able to assist with the Pilgrims’ family if needed during their weekend.
        tell_pilgrims: How much should I tell my Pilgrim about what is going to happen on the Walk?
        tell_pilgrims_text: "Everything, but as little as possible. As it is possible for enterprising Pilgrims to look up “what goes on during the Walk to Emmaus” online, it is best to answer all questions truthfully. Here is a general outline you can follow when talking to a perspective pilgrim: Emmaus is like a short course in Christianity with the goal of renewing and refreshing their Christian Walk. They will hear a series of 15 short talks over the weekend, and that each talk builds on the previous talks. There will be discussions, singing, and opportunities for some artistic expression. There will definitely be laughter, and possibly even some tears. Kleenex will be provided. Each day will provide time for prayer, meditations, and Holy Communion. They will have free time to relax and walk on the beach. They will even be fed three meals a day! Just don’t give details. You can always fall back on the Emmaus mantra: 'Don’t Anticipate!'"
        hardship: My friend very recently suffered an unexpected loss of a close family member. I really want to send this person to Emmaus right now, because I believe it is the best way to help him/her get through the tragedy. Is this a good reason to sponsor them?
        hardship_text: An Emmaus weekend should never be used as a “quick fix” for a person who is in deep personal pain or emotional upheaval. While it is true the Pilgrim would no doubt find a great deal of support from table mates, the high emotions of the weekend could just easily put too much stress on your friend. He or she may end up feeling unable to relate to the discussions after talks, participate in the silly fun of the poster parties or be completely overwhelmed with Dying Moments or Candlelight. Another thing to remember is that your friend’s needs should never overwhelm the purpose of the table, which is to bring all the Pilgrims to a place of being able to share and contribute to the Table discussions together. It is best to allow a sufficient time of healing to pass before gently speaking to them again about attending a future weekend. In short, a pilgrim should attend Emmaus on God’s timetable, not ours.
        events: What are the four Events that a Sponsor should attend on behalf of their pilgrim?
        events_text: Sponsorship Hour, Candlelight, Closing, Follow-up (don’t forget to BRING your pilgrim to follow-up!)
        maximum: What is the maximum number of letters I can collect for my pilgrim?
        maximum_text: There is no maximum, but there IS a minimum! Each Sponsor is responsible for gathering a minimum 12 letters for the Pilgrim to read in the conference room. Overflow letters go into a packet for the pilgrim to read at home. Why do we only give them 12 letters in the Conference Room? This ensures that everyone has time to read the letters they do receive during the Walk before leaving for Closing, and also helps to keep other pilgrims from wondering why their sponsor only gave them 12 letters when someone else’s sponsor might have gathered 30 or more.
        important: What is the most important thing a sponsor needs to do before and after approaching someone about attending an Emmaus Weekend?
        important_text: Pray! Emmaus weekends, the team members, and all the Pilgrims need to be bathed in constant prayer from the whole community, but especially from the Sponsors. Sponsors should begin praying for their Pilgrim before ever approaching him or her about attending Emmaus, and should continue praying for the team and the pilgrims that God will draw together to create the unique experience that is Emmaus…don’t forget to sign up for your hour on the 72 hour prayer vigil!
        when_applications: When can I send in applications for the next walk?
        when_applications_text: Right Now! There is never a bad time to talk to someone about attending Emmaus, and getting their application in. You can even send in an application for the spring walks now, if that is a better time for your Pilgrim. We have already reserved dates at the Salt and Light Center for next spring, so send on the applications!
        agape: When you are making Agape for the Pilgrims, how many pieces should you make, and how should it be labeled?
        agape_text: "Please provide between 55-60 pieces per Walk, and label each piece (if practical), or the bag that you put each piece in, with both the name and city of your Reunion Group. (Ex: Friends of Cleopas, Wilmington). Remember that if we do not receive enough pieces of Agape to give to both the Conference Room team and the Pilgrims, we cannot use your Agape, and that would be a shame! The Assistant Lay Directors show each piece of Agape to the Pilgrims as they are put out in the Dining Room and Conference Room, and reads the name and location of the Reunion Group to them. Reunion Groups are an important part of Emmaus, and being able to show that there are many active Reunion Groups in our Community helps the Pilgrims learn about them during the Walk."
        prayer: Where does your name need to be placed to be seen by your pilgrim during his/her 72 hour walk, and what do you need to do at that time?
        prayer_text_html: Sign up for the 72 hour prayer wheel, and be sure to pray for your pilgrim, the team, and for the success of the walk during your designated hour.
