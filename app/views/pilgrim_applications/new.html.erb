      Applicants for the Emmaus Walk must first have a sponsor. This can be any youth or adult who has attended an
      Emmaus-type retreat through the Presbyterian, Episcopal or Catholic Church, including youth from a Chrysalis,
      Journey, and Kayak, and any adults who have attended Emmaus, Kairos, Kairos Outside, and Cursillo (Presented by
      the Catholic church and the original model for Emmaus). Once a person has attended any one of these weekend
      retreats, that person may sponsor an appropriate candidate for any of these weekends.
